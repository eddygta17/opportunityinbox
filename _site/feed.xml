&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a student, a working professional or just curious about technology, we will try to cater for all needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woo-Tech would like to help you think outside the box, mainly by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encouraging and involving more women in technological fields&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping students build careers by matching them with mentors in the professional field based on similar interests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping professions/non-students seeking to move into technical career by matching them with students for better learning opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a platform/ forum for voicing out doubts, questions (either anonymously or not) to seek help from other women/men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Men are more than welcome to join as mentors and just be an exciting part of the community. Infact, we want men here! JOIN US!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;please-join-by-filling-this-form&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/FWFNi5&quot;&gt;Please join by filling this form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once a mentee approaches with a set of problems, they will be allocated a mentor based on case by case
profile fit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both the mentee and mentor will be notified of the same.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mentee can contact and seek advice from mentor within 1 week of the same, after which the
mentorship period ends. In case the mentee does not approach the mentor or there is no response from the
mentor, we will reallocate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We encourage use of our slack channel for communication, but it is flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At a time, at most 1 mentee will be allocated to a mentor!
We call this one-time and on-demand. The next mentor allocation will take place, once a mentee re-requests
for a mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
