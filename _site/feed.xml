&lt;p&gt;The Developer Relations team in India  is running the Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC) Study Jam series in India from July to November. Study Jams are a series of free, community run, in-person study groups. The objective of Study Jams is to raise the technical proficiency of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning Crash Course is one of Google’s most popular &amp;amp; free courses. The course develops intuition around fundamental machine learning concepts. This course has been taken by over 18,000 Google engineers &amp;amp; is now available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MLCC is intended for those who wish to learn about ML from a practical, applied perspective that will enable them to use machine learning within their everyday projects, and who wish to benefit from the power of TensorFlow wrapped in convenient higher-level abstractions. This is a great opportunity for audience with basic technical knowledge and limited Machine Learning knowledge willing to gain some practical experience in ML and TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

Whereas all the previous five editions of the free-of-cost programme took place in Silicon Valley, this one will be held in Bengaluru, for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;As part of Launchpad Accelerator India, the shortlisted startups will get support from Google in artificial intelligence, cloud, user experience, Android, web, product strategy and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country-focused accelerator programme builds on Google’s ‘Solve for India’ pilot launched last year, which identified many startups for a boot camp, where the founders and their teams spent four days with experts from Google and mentors from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
