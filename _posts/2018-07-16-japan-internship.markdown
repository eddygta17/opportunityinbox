he East Asia Korea-Japan internship program is a non-paid internship organized by the Korean NGO Asia Hope Camp Organization, and by the Japanese NGO Acopia Friendship International.
Are you looking for a working experience in Asia? To travel in Korean or in Japan? To learn a new language or discover East Asian culture? Perhaps all three at once?

If your answer is "Yes!" to any of these questions, our East Asia Korea-Japan internship program is exactly what you need.

Our internship is a 6-months internship open all year-round. This means interns can apply whenever and choose their working period as they wish.

__Round trip ticket will be provided by ACOPIA (flight from Incheon airport to Kumamoto Airport and back.)__
