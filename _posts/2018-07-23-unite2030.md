*Passionate about climate change? Want to create a project that saves the planet? Dedicated to saving our oceans?*

Applications are still open for UNITE2030: Hack for the Planet.

UNITE 2030 is a global, virtual, `48-hour hackathon` for positive social change. It's a great opportunity to meet young people from all over the world, sharpen your leadership skills, enhance your problem solving and critical thinking skills, all while developing solutions to the world's most critical challenges! You'll join a global community of worldchangers working together to solve challenges, and gain a network of new partners who can help you drive the world forward.

After UNITE 2030, you'll become an ambassador for social change in your community, leading the charge toward positive impact by becoming a leader in your area.

__At Hack for the Planet, we'll be tackling issues like climate change, responsible consumption & production, and life on land + life below water!__
