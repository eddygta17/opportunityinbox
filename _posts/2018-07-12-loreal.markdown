L'Oréal India strongly believes that Science is the source of progress, and the contribution of women is vital to its future. That is why we have initiated the L'Oréal India For Young Women in Science Scholarship Programme, which encourages and supports young women to pursue careers in science.

The programme was instituted in 2003 and has consistently helped young women to pursue scientific studies. A scholarship of Rs. 250,000/- each is granted to promising but economically disadvantaged young women and covers college fees for study in any scientific field in a recognized college or university in India.

The scholarship consists of up to Rs. 2.5 lacs, granted in equal annual instalments over the period of the degree of study, subject to the submission of proof of the candidate passing each year.

Till date we have given 300 scholarships.

This scholarship is open for study in any field of Science: Medicine, Engineering, Information Technology, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, and other graduate courses pertaining to Science (B.Sc) etc.

This Scholarship is only for girl students desirous of pursuing a degree course in Science/ Medical/ Engineering/ Biotechnology or any other scientific field, in a recognized institute in India.
