>BUILD A WEB APP THAT WILL IMPROVE LIFE HERE ON EARTH.

*The World Challenge is a challenge to the world. The purpose is to bring the world closer together through innovative solutions that we each build and then collectively share with each other.* Open source solutions serving your community needs, can then benefit every other city!


Almost every city needs the same data management tools as every other city. If cities were to share their solutions with each other, this would multiply their investment by the number of cities participating, massively increasing Earth’s collective productivity for livability on planet Earth.
