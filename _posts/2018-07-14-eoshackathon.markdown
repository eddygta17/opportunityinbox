The EOS Global Hackathon series is a first-of-its-kind event in the world of blockchain that serves Block.oneâ€™s goal of supporting a decentralized global community from the ground up.

From June through the end of 2018, Block.one will be hosting a series of initiatives designed to find and give a platform to the most visionary architects of decentralization out there.

Four in-person events will be followed by a Grand Finale Pitch Competition that puts the best applications under the spotlight.
