Google has announced the sixth edition of Launchpad Accelerator India this year, aimed at startups in artificial intelligence. Whereas all the previous five editions of the free-of-cost programme took place in Silicon Valley, this one will be held in Bengaluru, for the first time. And, as opposed to remaining open to any startup from across the globe previously, this year’s edition will focus only on Indian startups, helping them build scalable solutions for the country’s unique problems. 

## Applications for the first class, which will start in September 2018, are invited till July 31.

The three-month accelerator will provide 8-10 Indian startups with mentorship and access to Google’s network and technologies, along with up to $100,000 worth of Google Cloud Credits.

As part of Launchpad Accelerator India, the shortlisted startups will get support from Google in artificial intelligence, cloud, user experience, Android, web, product strategy and marketing.

The country-focused accelerator programme builds on Google’s ‘Solve for India’ pilot launched last year, which identified many startups for a boot camp, where the founders and their teams spent four days with experts from Google and mentors from the industry.
