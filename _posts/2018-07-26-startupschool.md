__Startup School is a free, 10-week, online course.__

 It’s designed for any startup founder who would like to get help through the earliest, most difficult challenges of starting a company.

The course will begin on __August 27, 2018__ and applications are now open at [StartupSchool.org.](https://www.startupschool.org/)


Startup School is designed for any startup founder who would like to get help through the earliest, most difficult challenges of starting a company. Founders may choose to join the Startup School community and meet with an advisor on a weekly basis, or to simply follow along with the course by watching the lectures and materials. In both cases, the class is completely free.

Throughout the 10 weeks, we watched founders build products, talk to users, create local communities, and launch their companies. 1,587 (56%) of the companies completed the course, and, since then, 38 of them have been accepted to the core Y Combinator program and received YC funding.

Our goal is to help everyone, regardless of who or where they are, start their startup. The materials from this year’s Startup School, like those from previous years, will remain online after the course finishes as a permanent resource for all startup founders.
