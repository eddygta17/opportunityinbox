The Climate Reality Project Philippines is looking for summer interns to work in our Quezon City office!

The Climate Reality Project Philippines (TCRP), a nonprofit organization founded by former US Vice President Al Gore, is dedicated to leading a global cultural movement demanding immediate action on the climate crisis by using cutting-edge communications and grassroots strategies to educate the public about the urgency and solvability of the climate crisis.

TCRPâ€™s Student Internship Program is an unpaid program that aims to provide undergraduate students a practical experience working in an international organization who is working to localize climate science, policy, and communication. The program can also be an opportunity for the students to be engaged in different Philippine-based climate action initiatives where they can express their activism while completing their academic requirements.
