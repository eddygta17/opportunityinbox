TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment, and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.

Every year, the TED Fellows program selects a new class of extraordinary thinkers and doers by open application. We look for innovators on the rise in their respective fields with a bold, original approach to their work. All applicants must be 18 years or older.
