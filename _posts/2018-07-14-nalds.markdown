NaLDS is an international conference with 120 delegates. It is different to other AIESEC conferences, because it isn't about AIESEC regarding functional input or exchange knowledge and your position in AIESEC doesn't matter at all. The focus of the conference is your personal development. It offers you a chance to reflect your values and potential, to explore your strengths and to find your personal authentic way of leadership. 

## Application Deadline: Sunday the 15.07.2018 23:59 (UTC+1)
