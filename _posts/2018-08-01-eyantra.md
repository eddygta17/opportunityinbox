e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition for undergraduate students in Engineering/ Science/ Polytechnic colleges.

The competition has evolved over the years to include more number of teams by introducing different Tracks in the competition. Currently in its seventh edition, eYRC-2018 introduces multiple Tracks – all Tracks are conducted in parallel and Finals for all Tracks are planned to be held at IIT Bombay in March 2019. Each Track may contain one or more Themes – problem statements abstracted into a game rulebook. Details will be disclosed after the selection test.



Students participate as a team of four– with each team member taking the test simultaneously. A team’s selection test score is used to determine eligibility of the team to participate in the competition. A Team’s selection test score along with other factors such as participation of team member/s in the past competitions may be used to assign Tracks and Themes to the team. e-Yantra holds complete discretion in the selection and Track/Theme assignment processes.

>The winners of this competition are eligible for a summer internship at IITB through the e-Yantra Summer Internship Program (eYSIP).
