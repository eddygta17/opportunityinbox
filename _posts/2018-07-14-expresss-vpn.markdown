The ExpressVPN Future of Privacy Scholarship was created to raise awareness of internet privacy and security.

The internet is undoubtedly having a transformative effect on our education system.

ExpressVPN found, for instance, that virtually all classrooms across the US are being equipped with unprotected high-speed broadband, leaving them open to data breaches, cyber attacks, and surveillance. Across the pond, UK schools are pouring billions into educational technology for both teachers and students, but more than a quarter of them still lack basic cybersecurity measures to keep such technology secure.

As the number of internet-ready devices entering classrooms in the US and the UK skyrockets, so do the threats and vulnerabilities to the privacy of the individuals who use them. Awareness, then, of online security and a fundamental understanding of privacy rights are more important than ever.

Why Should You Enter?
You will have a chance to win a $5,000 cash prize.

The winner will be featured on multiple communications platforms. 
This is a great resume-builder for a career in journalism or any relevant field of study.
