Over the past several years, Accenture has been conducting annual innovation contests. These contests have been well received by students across the country, with more than 20,000 innovations pouring in on varied themes. Out of these great innovations, we’ve seen a few being successfully taken to the market as well.

If you are a student in India aged 18 years and above, and pursuing a full-time undergraduate or post-graduate course, you are eligible to participate in the Accenture Innovation Challenge. You can participate as an individual or in teams of up to four members.
If you need to get in touch with us, please use the Live Chat facility on the website. We are live on every Tuesday and Thursday between 2:30 PM and 4:30 PM. You could also send us an offline message to which we will revert as soon as we can.

## This year’s contest themes are – Innovate for Businesses, Innovate for the Society
