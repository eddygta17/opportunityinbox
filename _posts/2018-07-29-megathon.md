*A mega brainstorming of life hacks over a marathon session. And this student-led event jointly organized by the Entrepreneurial-cells (E-cells) of IIIT-H and IIT Hyderabad respectively is here again, but in different avataars.*

>With a view to dissolving geographical boundaries and making the event accessible to students from across the country, an online edition is now being made available. One of the social challenges presented last year was in the realm of Women’s Safety.


- Dates: 15th July – 12th August, 2018
- Eligibility Criteria: Any Indian college student with a valid student ID can participate.
