## Harvard Academy Scholars Program for Postgraduate USA in 2018

The Harvard Academy for International and national Studies, a foundation of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University, supports the Academy Scholars Program. This program is available to all ongoing Ph.D. beneficiaries and doctoral applicants.

The Academy Scholars Program distinguishes and underpins extraordinary researchers toward the beginning of their vocations whose work consolidates disciplinary greatness in the sociologies (counting history and law) with a charge of the dialect, history, or culture of non-Western nations or districts. Their grant may explain household, near, or transnational issues, past or display.

# [Applications are welcome from qualified people without respect to nationality, gender, or race.](https://academy.wcfia.harvard.edu/programs/academy_scholar)
